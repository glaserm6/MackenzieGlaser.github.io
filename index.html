                <p>I am a freshman at Northern Kentucky University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Neuroscience, 
                    and a dedicated participant in the university's L.I.F.E. Fellowship program. 
                    My academic journey is anchored in the intersections of artificial intelligence, software development, and neuroscience, 
                    where I strive to explore new frontiers in human-computer interaction and cognitive processing. <br><br>

                    Currently, I am an AI Eye-Tracking Researcher in an interdisciplinary project that leverages machine learning to analyze eye movement patterns and interpret visual attention. 
                    This work aims to uncover insights into human cognition and user experience, with potential applications in both medical diagnostics and consumer design. 
                    In addition to my research experience, my academic background includes college-level coursework completed during high school, 
                    a Silver Award in the National German Exam, and active involvement in the National Honor Society, 
                    where I engaged in leadership and service roles.

                    <br><br> I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub, 
                    and have a foundational understanding of AI applications in neuroscience. 
                    My collaborative and analytical skills are key strengths I bring to any team, alongside a drive to expand my knowledge in AI, software development, and interdisciplinary research. 
                    <br><br> I invite you to explore my portfolio to learn more about my academic achievements, research, and skills.
