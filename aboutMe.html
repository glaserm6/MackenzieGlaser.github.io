        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="about-content">
        <p> Hi there! Iâ€™m Mackenzie Glaser, and I grew up in the Northern Kentucky region. From an early age I considered myself a very curious person. I always had a drive to discover the unknown. As I have gotten older, that has translated to the very approach I take on life. I am always looking forward to discovering the next massive thing, and to answer my questions that come my way. This is why Computer Science as my career has been such a great fit. It has provided me with not only research opportunities, but it also satisfies my thirst for knowledge.  </p>
        <p>I would consider myself a passionate <span class="highlight-key">Computer Science</span> student at Northern Kentucky University with a minor in Neuroscience. I thrive on exploring the intersections of technology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience, aiming to push the boundaries of <span class="highlight-key">human-computer interaction</span> and cognitive science.</p>

        <p>Currently, I'm involved in an <span class="highlight-key">AI Eye-Tracking Research</span> project where I apply machine learning to study eye movement and visual attention patterns. This research could revolutionize fields like <span class="highlight-key">medical diagnostics</span> and <span class="highlight-key">user experience design</span>.</p>

                <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
            <P>Some fun facts about myself are that I can never turn down a puzzle, which usually leads me to never try and participate in one unless I want to be wide awake for the next 24 hours until it is done. I play about 4 instruments and currently have been focusing on my guitar skills. I also love the outdoors, and I look forward to Spring and Fall when the weather is exactly right for a nice hike. I love anything Star Wars or Dune related (yes, I realize one is a copycat of another, but we do not need to go into that now). My favorite food used to be spaghetti, however, after gluten has decided to be my archnemesis, it has now changed (a bit reluctantly if I might add) to sushi. I have two wonderful parents, and a magnificent sister, all of whom I am immensely proud of. And lastly, at my very soul I am a theater kid and will never turn down an opportunity to recite Shakespeare or break out into a monologue.  </P>
